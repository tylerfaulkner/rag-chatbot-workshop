# Workshop Demo: Building a Knowledge Base Chatbot

Welcome to the workshop! In this tutorial, you'll be implementing your own Knowledge Base Chatbot in a Next.JS project.

A UI has been built for you, since the focus of this tutorial is on implementing the Retrieval Augmented Generation Concepts.

Part of the decision behind using node was to use a single language for all development and to get access to the large package ecosystem. One of the primary packages being used is the AI SDK developed by the Next.JS team which allows easy yet robust interface for creating AI powered applications with support for any model provider

Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and get started with the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Git**: Version control system.
2. **NVM (Node Version Manager)**: To manage and install Node.js versions.

## Step 1: Installing Git

1. **Windows**:
   - Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
   - Follow the installer instructions and choose the default settings.

2. **macOS**:
   - Open the Terminal.
   - Install Git using Homebrew (if you have Homebrew installed):
     ```sh
     brew install git
     ```

3. **Linux**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Install Git using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
     ```sh
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install git
     ```

Verify the installation by running:
```sh
git --version
```

## Step 2: Installing NVM (Node Version Manager)

1. **Windows**:
   - Download and install NVM for Windows from [github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).
   - Follow the installer instructions and choose the default settings.

2. **macOS and Linux**:
   - Open the Terminal.
   - Run the following command to install NVM:
     ```sh
     curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
     ```
   - Close and reopen your terminal, or run:
     ```sh
     source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
     ```

Verify the installation by running:
```sh
nvm --version
```

### Troubleshooting Steps

There appears to be an issues with NVM and administrator privelages.

#### NVM not recognized Recovery Steps
1. Go to Environment Variables in windows
  a. search for envrionment variables in windows search
  b. find option called "Edit the environment variables"
2. Click on "Environment Variables..." in the bottom right corner
3. The nvm installer should have setup NVM_HOME and NVM_SYMLINK
4. Ensures the PATH variable has a reference to this variables
  a. Double click path
  b. If you need to add the variables reference
    i. Add %NVM_HOME% in a new line
    ii. Add %NVM_SYMLINK% on a seperate line

#### `nvm use --lts` not working

Remove the hyphens from lts and it should run.

## Step 3: Installing Node.js using NVM

With NVM installed, you can easily install and manage Node.js versions.
We will be using the most recent Long Term Service (LTS) version 

1. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js:
   ```sh
   nvm install --lts
   ```
2. Set the current version of Node 
    ```sh
    nvm use --lts
    ```
3. Verify the installation
    ```sh
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

## Step 4: Setting up the project

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tylerfaulkner/rag-chatbot-workshop.git
    cd rag-chatbot-workshop
    ```

2. Install Project Dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Navigate to **`http://localhost:3000`** to see the application running

## Conclusion

You now have succesfully setup and have your application running. Through the course of the workshop you will be integrating OpenAI and Azure AI Search into the application.

# Auto Generated Next.JS README Section
The following is the autogenerated README from using a Next.JS template.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
